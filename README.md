## Description

This is a basic calculator project created as an assessment on The Odin Project's curriculum. The calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's designed to solve basic mathematical problems like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The primary goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate proficiency in web development technologies, including user interface design and JavaScript programming.


## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Input Handling**: The calculator provides an easy-to-use interface for entering numerical values and operators.
- **Clear Functionality**: Users can clear the input or reset the calculator for a new calculation.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the number buttons and operator buttons to input your calculations.
3. Click the "=" button to see the result of the calculation.
4. Click the "AC" button to clear the input and start a new calculation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Improvements

While this project covers the fundamentals of creating a basic calculator, I intend to:
- Improve the visual design to make the calculator more appealing.
- Add keyboard support for improved usability.
- Incorporating error handling for edge cases.
